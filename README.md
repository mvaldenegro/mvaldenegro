I am a researcher at the Interactive Machine Learning team of the [German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence](www.dfki.de), [Robotics Innovation Center](robotik.dfki-bremen.de/) in Bremen, Germany. Before returning to Germany, I was a Marie Curie Fellow at the Ocean Systems Lab at Heriot-Watt University.

I am interested in making robots be able to “see” and perceive just as humans do. My research interests are in Deep Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Uncertainty Quantification, Robot Vision, and Underwater Robotics.

I regularly teach courses at the University of Bremen and teach and supervise Master Students at the Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg’s Master of Autonomous Systems Program.

I received my PhD in Electrical Engineering from Heriot-Watt University in 2019, a Master of Science Degree in Autonomous Systems from Hochschule Bonn-Rhein-Sieg in 2014, and an Engineering Degree from Universidad Tecnologica Metropolitana in 2009. I have 4 years of professional experience before starting my Masters in Europe.

My PhD Thesis deals with the problem of detecting submerged marine debris in sonar images using neural networks. I have the strong belief that we should not be polluting our oceans and bodies of water, as it is a vital element for our survival. My PhD research was developed in the context of the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Initial Training Network Robocademy which was funded by the European Commission (FP7-PEOPLE-2013-ITN, Ref 608096).
